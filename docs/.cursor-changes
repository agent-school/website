2026-02-12 skillbuilder-nested-button
- Goal: fix invalid HTML / React error when clicking "Try Interactive Demo" in SkillBuilderDemo.
- Prior state: `<motion.button>` wrapped an inner `<button>` for "Decision Point" — nesting buttons is invalid HTML and caused runtime error.
- New effect:
  - Replaced inner `<button>` with `<span role="button" tabIndex={0}>` for the "Decision Point" toggle.
  - Added onKeyDown handler for Enter/Space to preserve keyboard accessibility.
  - Added cursor-pointer to span for visual affordance.

2026-02-12 legal-pages
- Goal: add Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.
- Prior state: Footer had placeholder "#" links for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- New effect:
  - Created `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` with comprehensive Privacy Policy (15 sections) covering data collection, usage, GDPR, CCPA, cookies, security, retention, user rights, and contact.
  - Created `src/app/terms/page.tsx` with Terms of Service (19 sections) covering acceptance, eligibility, license, IP, acceptable use, disclaimers, liability, termination, DMCA, and governing law.
  - Updated Footer links from "#" to "/privacy" and "/terms".
  - Added both pages to sitemap.ts for SEO discoverability.
  - Content based on research (TermsFeed, GetTerms SaaS templates) and tailored for Agent School context.

2026-02-10 debug-01
- Goal: diagnose `next dev`/`next build` hangs with runtime evidence.
- Prior state: no runtime telemetry around build/page-data execution paths.
- New effect:
  - Added instrumentation to `src/components/mocks/crm/data.ts` to log deal generation start, exhaustion condition, and completion.
  - Added instrumentation to `next.config.mjs` to log Next config evaluation and current working directory.
  - Added instrumentation to `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/sitemap.ts` to log server render/page-data checkpoints.
2026-02-10 debug-02
- Goal: clean up temporary debug instrumentation after user-confirmed fix.
- Prior state: temporary fetch-based instrumentation remained in 4 files.
- New effect:
  - Removed all debug instrumentation from `src/components/mocks/crm/data.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, `src/app/page.tsx`, and `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
  - Runtime behavior is unchanged except debug events are no longer emitted.
2026-02-10 docs-01
- Goal: document the resolved build/dev hang incident.
- Prior state: incident existed but no dedicated report for this specific "Collecting page data"/"Compiling / ..." hang.
- New effect:
  - Added `docs/bugs/build-hang-collecting-page-data-feb-2026.md` with summary, symptoms, root cause, mitigation, prevention, and verification checklist.
  - Updated `docs/bugs/readme.md` Active Reports table to link the new report.
2026-02-10 debug-03
- Goal: capture fresh runtime evidence for recurring compile hang.
- Prior state: no active instrumentation after cleanup.
- New effect:
  - Added debug checkpoints in `next.config.mjs`, `src/components/mocks/crm/index.ts`, `src/components/mocks/crm/data.ts`, `src/app/demos/crm/page.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.
  - Instrumentation now records module-eval and render/data-generation checkpoints to `.cursor/debug.log` via local ingest endpoint.
2026-02-10 debug-04
- Goal: isolate build stall stage inside metadata/page-data generation.
- Prior state: build stalled before enough route-level evidence to isolate source.
- New effect:
  - Added debug checkpoints to `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`, and `src/app/manifest.ts`.
  - Extended instrumentation coverage to include metadata route generation during `Collecting page data`.
2026-02-10 debug-05
- Goal: apply fix backed by runtime evidence from CLI behavior.
- Prior state: `dev` and `build` scripts still launched Turbopack despite `NEXT_TURBOPACK=0`, and build repeatedly stalled at page-data collection.
- New effect:
  - Updated `package.json` scripts to force webpack for default `dev` and `build`.
  - Added explicit turbo opt-in scripts (`build:turbo` retained/added, `dev:turbo` kept) for manual testing.
2026-02-10 debug-06
- Goal: reduce debug side effects during build-stage diagnosis.
- Prior state: top-level instrumentation in `next.config.mjs` fired on every build process bootstrap and provided low-signal data.
- New effect:
  - Removed temporary `next.config.mjs` instrumentation while keeping route/data instrumentation active.
2026-02-10 debug-07
- Goal: test worker-layer hypothesis for pre-route build stall.
- Prior state: build hung at `Collecting page data` before any route instrumentation fired.
- New effect:
  - Changed `next.config.mjs` experimental `webpackBuildWorker` from `true` to `false` to disable build worker threading for verification.
2026-02-10 debug-08
- Goal: test whether high prerender worker fan-out causes page-data deadlock.
- Prior state: build consistently stalled at `Collecting page data using 21 workers`.
- New effect:
  - Set `experimental.cpus = 1` in `next.config.mjs` to force single-worker page-data processing during verification.
2026-02-10 debug-09
- Goal: test static-worker runtime mode hypothesis.
- Prior state: build still stalled with single prerender worker.
- New effect:
  - Set `experimental.workerThreads = false` in `next.config.mjs` to force process-based workers during page-data phase.
2026-02-10 debug-10
- Goal: test suspected hidden static route as hang trigger.
- Prior state: build hang persisted before any route-level instrumentation logs; discovered `src/app/test-demos/page.tsx` imports multiple heavy demos and lacked dynamic rendering override.
- New effect:
  - Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";` to `src/app/test-demos/page.tsx` for isolation verification.
2026-02-10 debug-11
- Goal: test global static-generation bypass hypothesis.
- Prior state: build still hung at page-data collection after route-specific and worker-mode changes.
- New effect:
  - Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";` in `src/app/layout.tsx` to force dynamic rendering for app routes during verification.
2026-02-10 debug-12
- Goal: fix confirmed infinite-loop risk in CRM mock data generation.
- Prior state: `generateDeals()` enforced uniqueness with unbounded `while` loop even after all companies were already used.
- New effect:
  - Replaced unbounded uniqueness loop with bounded sampling:
    - pick from remaining unique companies while available
    - fall back to regular sampling once pool is exhausted
2026-02-10 debug-13
- Goal: trace module-evaluation stage for app routes during build page-data phase.
- Prior state: most instrumentation fired inside component functions; build could stall before function execution.
- New effect:
  - Added top-level module-evaluation logs to `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/demos/*/page.tsx`, `src/app/test-notion/page.tsx`, and `src/app/test-demos/page.tsx`.
2026-02-10 debug-14
- Goal: test eager-import hypothesis for homepage compile delays/hangs.
- Prior state: `/` can appear stuck at `Compiling / ...`; `UseCases` currently imports all mock demos eagerly.
- New effect:
  - Added module-evaluation logs to `UseCases.tsx` and mock index modules (`hotel-pms`, `notion`, `instagram`, `granola`) to trace whether homepage compile triggers broad demo graph loading.
2026-02-10 debug-15
- Goal: reduce compile-time pseudo-hang caused by eager demo imports on homepage.
- Prior state: `UseCases.tsx` imported all demo modules eagerly; first `/` compile frequently took ~25-33s and appeared hung.
- New effect:
  - Switched `UseCases.tsx` demo modules (`hotel-pms`, `crm`, `instagram`, `notion`, `granola`) to `next/dynamic` lazy loading with a loading fallback and `ssr:false`.
2026-02-12 docs-index-01
- Goal: improve and update docs/index.md table of contents.
- Prior state: index.md had no top-level TOC; links pointed to moved paths (e.g. development-guide.md, mcp-setup.md under guides/).
- New effect:
  - Added Table of Contents with anchor links to all major sections.
  - Updated links: dev/development-guide.md, dev/deployment-guide.md, dev/mcp-setup.md; design/design-system-new-purposal.md.
  - Added DEMO_FIX_SUMMARY.md and debug-changelog-feb-2026.md to Bug Tracking; added SITEMAP.md and session-history.md to Reference.
  - Index version 1.0.0 → 1.1.0; last updated 2026-02-12.
2026-02-12 docs-bugs-01
- Goal: rename bug reports with exact dates; convert DEMO_FIX_SUMMARY to proper format; fix bug readme.
- Prior state: filenames used MMM-YYYY (e.g. feb-2026); DEMO_FIX_SUMMARY was a fix summary, not a bug report; readme had old links and naming convention.
- New effect:
  - Renamed all bug reports to YYYY-MM-DD format: build-hang-2026-02-10, build-timeout-2026-02-09, debug-changelog-2026-02-10, demo-not-interactive-2026-02-10, invalid-turbopack-config-2026-02-10, performance-compilation-issues-2026-02-10, turbopack-wsl-hang-2026-02-10.
  - Replaced DEMO_FIX_SUMMARY with demo-fix-implementation-2026-02-10.md (proper bug report format: summary, symptoms, root cause, solution, verification).
  - Updated docs/bugs/readme.md: Active Reports table with new filenames, Quick Reference links, naming convention (issue-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md), Related Documentation paths (design-system, mock-ui-framework).
  - Updated cross-references in docs/index.md, docs/README.md, docs/dev/development-guide.md, docs/brownfield/source-tree-analysis.md, docs/bugs/demo-not-interactive-2026-02-10.md.
2026-02-12 docs-org-01
- Goal: organize docs to distinguish Original (cream/orange) vs BMAD Redesign.
- Prior state: docs mixed without clear era labeling; broken links to moved files (planning/redesign-roadmap deleted, guides/components-guide moved to design/).
- New effect:
  - Created docs/DOCS_STRUCTURE.md — canonical index of docs by era (Original / BMAD Redesign / Shared).
  - Created docs/legacy/ folder: README.md (explains deprecated original docs), legacy-design-reference.md (navy/amber/cream palette for migration reference).
  - Updated docs/README.md: added "Original vs BMAD Redesign" section; fixed links (design-system-new-purposal, mock-ui-framework, components-guide, brownfield/redesign-roadmap).
  - Updated docs/index.md: added era section; fixed all broken paths (project-overview, technology-stack, component-inventory, source-tree-analysis → brownfield/; mock-ui-framework, components-guide → design/).
2026-02-12 ui-fixes-02
- Goal: fix stats label color, use square logos, fix scroll-to-top.
- Prior state: Stats labels still gray in dark mode; non-square logos; page loaded at bottom.
- New effect:
  - Hero stats: dark:!text-white to force white labels (Accuracy Rate, Faster Training, Cost Reduction).
  - Navbar/Footer: switched to agent school icon dark square.png / agent school icon light square.png.
  - Scroll: head script sets scrollRestoration=manual + scrollTo(0,0) before React; ScrollToTop uses useLayoutEffect.
2026-02-12 ui-fixes-03
- Goal: stop homepage jumping to bottom, enforce logo/theme correctness, and keep hero stats readable.
- Prior state: landing sometimes opened near the meeting demo/CTA area; navbar could show wrong light/dark logo; hero stat text still not visually white enough.
- New effect:
  - AgentInterface now scrolls only its own message container (`scrollTo` on panel) and no longer calls `scrollIntoView` that could move the page.
  - Navbar logo now uses the dark square icon consistently to avoid light-logo-on-light-theme mismatch.
  - Hero stat cards now render with dark glass styling and white number/label text for `99% Accuracy Rate`, `10x Faster Training`, and `95% Cost Reduction`.
