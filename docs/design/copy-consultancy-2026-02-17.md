## Copywriting Strategy

### Core Principles Applied

Research from Nielsen Norman Group, Stripe, and top-performing B2B service sites points to six universal rules for converting non-technical buyers:

#### 1. Lead with the Problem, Not the Product
SMB owners don't search for "AI automation platforms." They search for "how to stop spending 3 hours on invoices." The copy must open with a pain they already feel — not a solution they don't yet know exists. **The first sentence should make them nod.**

#### 2. Plain English Over Jargon
Every technical term (RPA, deterministic, LLM, certification pipeline) is a conversion killer for a non-technical audience. The rule: if your accountant or restaurant owner couldn't define it in 5 seconds, rewrite it. Replace "deterministic workflows" with "it works the same way every time."

#### 3. Outcomes Over Features
"We watch your workflow and build an AI to replicate it" is a feature. "Your team gets back 3 hours a day" is an outcome. SMBs buy outcomes. Every feature description must answer the implicit question: "So what does that mean for my business?"

#### 4. One CTA, Repeated Clearly
Stripe's homepage has one primary action ("Get started") repeated in the nav, hero, and footer. Multiple competing CTAs (demo, pilot, email, explore) dilute intent. Our primary CTA is a single free 30-minute discovery call — low commitment, high trust signal.

#### 5. Specificity Builds Trust, Vagueness Destroys It
"Save time" is ignored. "Get back 3 hours every Monday morning" is believed. The Geometry Solution case study (40+ hrs/week saved) is the most credible thing on the site. Real specifics beat broad claims. Until we have more data, we use qualitative specifics ("imagine doing that in 10 seconds") rather than fabricated percentages.

#### 6. Reframe Numbers Honestly
The old copy claimed "99% accuracy" and "10x faster" as hard facts. These are aspirational targets. The rewrite frames them as directional ("up to 10x faster", "near-perfect accuracy on tested workflows") which is honest, still compelling, and doesn't expose the brand to credibility questions.

Six Ways We Make Your Business Run Itself
```

**Section Description:**
```
You don't need to understand how it works under the hood. Here's what it means for your business.
```

---

**Feature 1: Show Us Once, It Runs Forever**
- *Old title: "Teach Once, Automate Forever"*
- **New subtitle:** Run Any Task on Autopilot
- **New description:** Walk us through how you do something — just once, in plain English or by showing us. We turn that into an AI that does it for you, every time, exactly the way you'd do it. No code. No setup on your end. No complexity.
- **New bullets:**
  - Just show us or describe what you do
  - We handle the rest — no technical knowledge needed
  - Works for any repeatable task your team does today
  - Handles exceptions and edge cases automatically

---

**Feature 2: Tested Before It Touches Your Business**
- *Old title: "99% Reliability, Guaranteed"*
- **New subtitle:** Nothing Goes Live Until It's Proven
- **New description:** Before any automation runs in your business, we put it through its paces — hundreds of test runs across real scenarios. You only get an automation that we're confident works. If it doesn't meet the bar, it doesn't ship.
- **New bullets:**
  - Hundreds of test scenarios before going live
  - You set the standard — we meet it
  - Full failure analysis on anything that doesn't pass
  - You see the results before it touches real work

---

**Feature 3: You Always Know What's Happening**
- *Old title: "Perfect Transparency"*
- **New subtitle:** No Mystery, No Black Box
- **New description:** Handing work to an AI can feel scary. That's why every step your automation takes is visible, logged, and explainable. You can see exactly what it did, when, and why — anytime you want. No surprises.
- **New bullets:**
  - Every action is logged and reviewable
  - Step-by-step visibility into what the AI did
  - Easy to audit, adjust, or pause at any time
  - You're always in control

---

**Feature 4: Updates Itself When Your Software Changes**
- *Old title: "Software Changes, Agents Adapt"*
- **New subtitle:** It Doesn't Break When Things Change
- **New description:** Most automation tools break the moment your software updates or a screen looks different. Ours doesn't. When something changes in your tools, the automation notices, adjusts itself, and keeps working — without you lifting a finger.
- **New bullets:**
  - Handles software updates automatically
  - No maintenance calls to you when things change
  - Adapts to new screens, layouts, and workflows
  - The vast majority of changes require zero human input

---

**Feature 5: One Place to See Everything**
- *Old title: "Mission Control"*
- **New subtitle:** Your Automation Dashboard
- **New description:** See every automation running in your business from one simple dashboard. Get alerts if something needs attention. Set rules for what needs your approval. Stay informed without being in the weeds.
- **New bullets:**
  - Live status of all your automations in one view
  - Alerts when something needs a human decision
  - You control what gets flagged vs. runs automatically
  - Connects to tools you already use

---

**Feature 6: Runs Fast — Not Like a Chatbot**
- *Old title: "7x Speed Breakthrough"*
- **New subtitle:** Quick as a Keyboard Shortcut
- **New description:** Most AI tools think out loud — slowly. Ours executes like a seasoned employee who already knows the steps. Tasks that used to take minutes happen in seconds, and they run in the background while your team focuses on what actually matters.
- **New bullets:**
  - Seconds to complete tasks that used to take minutes
  - Runs quietly in the background
  - Works with your existing software — no API required
  - Scales effortlessly as your business grows

## What We Did NOT Change

- Use Cases demos — kept as-is (interactive, helpful for SMBs to visualize)
- Blog posts — kept as-is
- Design, colors, animations — unchanged (copy experiment only)
- Comparison pages (`/vs/manus`, `/vs/n8n`) — untouched
- Geometry Solution case study — kept as-is (real numbers, real credibility)
- Testimonials section — still commented out (no additional real quotes yet)
- Logos section — still commented out

---

## What Was Removed / Hidden

- `<Differentiation />` section (ROI calculator + comparison tables) — commented out
  - Reason: Too technical for non-technical SMB audience
  - The comparison tables assume familiarity with "RPA" and "LLM tokens"
  - Re-enable when: we have real benchmark data and are targeting technical buyers again

---

## Notes for Future Iterations

1. **Add a testimonial** — The Geometry Solution quote from Ryan Li is strong. Un-comment `<Testimonials />` when positioned right after the Use Cases section for social proof.
2. **Logo strip** — Un-comment `<LogosSection />` once we have 4–6 recognizable client logos. Blank logo strips reduce trust.
3. **Numbers** — Once we have 3+ real client engagements with tracked metrics, update the hero benefit pills back to specific numbers (e.g., "Saved a hotel 40 hours/week").
4. **CTA A/B test** — Consider testing "Book a Free Call" vs "Get a Free Workflow Audit" to see which converts better with cold traffic.
