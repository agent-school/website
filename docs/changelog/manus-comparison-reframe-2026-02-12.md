**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Page:** `/compare/manus` (Agent School vs Manus comparison)

---

## Goal

Remove direct references to Meta acquisition and instead emphasize Agent School's independence and data privacy as core architectural principles.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Page Metadata (lines 6-9)

- **Before:** "...over Manus (now Meta-owned)..."
- **After:** "...with true data independence"
- **Rationale:** Focus on our value proposition, not competitor's ownership

### 2. Hero Section (lines 17-31)

- **Removed:** Alert banner announcing Meta acquisition
- **Updated:** Hero subheading from "independence from Big Tech" to "true data independence"
- **Rationale:** Make independence about our principles, not reactive to competitors

### 3. Main Content Section — "Why Independence Matters" (lines 56-87)

**Before:** "What Happened: The Meta Acquisition"

- Listed specific concerns about Meta's acquisition
- Referenced CNBC reports about customer exodus
- Focused on regulatory scrutiny and China investigation

**After:** "Why Independence Matters"

- Reframed as Agent School's **architectural principles**:
  - No data monetization (we don't run ads or tracking)
  - Independent governance (customer-driven roadmap)
  - Predictable compliance (no conglomerate uncertainty)
  - On-premises deployment option (true data residency)
- Added philosophy callout: "Agent School exists solely to deliver reliable automation—not to monetize your data, sell ads, or build ecosystems"

### 4. Comparison Table (lines 89-191)

- **Column header:** "Manus (Meta)" → "Manus"
- **Ownership row:** "Meta subsidiary (acquired for $2B+ in late 2025)" → "Part of larger technology conglomerate with diverse business interests"
- **Rationale:** Neutral, factual description without naming specific companies

### 5. Data Privacy Section (lines 243-272)

**Before:** "Privacy and Independence"

- Focused on Meta's business model and data monetization
- Referenced China's investigation
- Mentioned Meta's track record with compliance teams

**After:** "Data Privacy and Architecture"

- Reframed as Agent School's **technical architecture**:
  - Zero telemetry by default
  - No model training on customer data
  - Transparent data flows (GDPR Article 30)
  - Air-gapped deployment option
- Final line: "Agent School is built for organizations where data privacy isn't a feature—it's a requirement"

### 6. Pricing Section (line 292)

- **Before:** "uncertain post-Meta; costs may rise"
- **After:** "varies by credit consumption"
- **Rationale:** Factual statement without speculation

### 7. Summary Sections

- Removed phrases like "Meta ownership notwithstanding" and "Big Tech dependencies"
- Updated to "true data independence" and "platform dependencies"

### 8. CTA Section (line 387)

- **Before:** "...independent, certified alternative to Meta-owned AI agents"
- **After:** "...independent, certified alternative for AI automation"
- **Rationale:** Focus on what we offer, not what we're replacing

### 9. Code Cleanup

- Removed unused `AlertTriangle` import (line 3)

## Overall Effect

**From:** Reactive positioning against Meta's acquisition  
**To:** Proactive positioning based on Agent School's core values

### Key Messaging Themes

1. **Independence as principle:** We're built for enterprise automation, not data monetization
2. **Architecture-first privacy:** Technical design ensures data sovereignty
3. **Customer alignment:** Our roadmap serves enterprise needs, not platform strategies
4. **Deployment flexibility:** On-premises option for true data residency

**No breaking changes.** All URLs, routing, and functionality remain identical.
