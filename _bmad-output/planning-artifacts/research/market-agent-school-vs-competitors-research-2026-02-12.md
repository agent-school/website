- https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/business/meta-manus-china-ai.html

**Core Value Proposition (Pre-Meta):**

"The action engine that goes beyond answers to execute tasks, automate workflows, and extend your human reach."

Manus positioned itself as a general-purpose AI agent platform that could perform research, build websites, create presentations, operate browsers, and automate workflows through natural language instructions.

| **Agent Skills** | Custom workflow builder using "open Agent Skills standard" for portability |
| **Slack Integration** | Team collaboration and bot deployment |

**Target Market:**

- **Individual knowledge workers** (researchers, analysts, content creators)
- **Small to medium teams** (marketing, sales, operations)
- **Students and educators** (via Manus Campus program)
- **Startups** (special startup program offered)

**Pricing Structure (Credit-Based):**

Manus uses a **credit consumption model** where different tasks consume varying amounts of credits:

| Plan | Price (Monthly) | Credits/Month | Best For |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Standard** | $19/mo ($16/mo annual) | 4,000 credits | Standard monthly usage, everyday tasks |
| **Customizable** | $39/mo ($32/mo annual) | 8,000 credits | Self-set usage, changing needs |
| **Extended** | $199/mo ($165/mo annual) | 40,000 credits | Large-scale tasks, batch production |
| **Team** | Custom | Custom | Team collaboration, shared credit pools |

Sources:
- https://manus.im/pricing
- https://manus.im/docs/introduction/plans

**Competitive Positioning:**

Manus positioned itself against **ChatGPT** (for reasoning) and **Lovable** (for code generation), emphasizing:
- Action-oriented (not just chat)
- Multi-modal capabilities (research + creation + automation)
- Exportable skills (no vendor lock-in via Agent Skills standard)

**Post-Acquisition Implications:**

The Meta acquisition creates several strategic considerations:

1. **Enterprise Hesitancy**: Companies concerned about Meta's data practices may avoid Manus
2. **Integration Potential**: Manus capabilities may be integrated into Meta's Workplace, WhatsApp, or other products
3. **Competitive Dynamics**: Meta now directly competes with Microsoft (via GitHub Copilot), Google (via Gemini agents), and independent automation platforms
4. **Pricing Changes**: Uncertain whether Meta will maintain current pricing or bundle with other services
